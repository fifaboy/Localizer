# Localizer
This project is an attempt to create a self-contained tool for localizing objects in images, inspired by multiple existing project. Parent projects: [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg), [Darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow), [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) and [Soccer ball detection](https://github.com/deep-diver/Soccer-Ball-Detection-YOLOv2).

Details of full workflow will be added later.
